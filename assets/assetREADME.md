## Individual Sprint 5
### CVCarter

Tried different assets in the game. 

### Assets of interest:

- **Instructions.png** - for menu or beside game to clarify gameplay (not yet implemented)
- **ratsprite.png** - rat in Medieval costume for player, used in <u>DefaultSpriteProvider.java</u>, line 10, 22
- **redsplat.png** - red splat used to indicate attack, used in <u>GameScreen.java</u>, line 61
- **target.png** - red target used to indicate where the player has selected to move, used in <u>GameScreen.java</u>, line 60
- **villager.png** - Medieval villager for NPC, used in <u>DefaultSpriteProvider.java</u>, line 11, 25

many other assets were created and attempted but were not used

the assets folders need to be cleaned out, but I didn't want to delete anything secretly being used

Also created a "save" to test player placement. Did not alter the dummy test saves.

Sidenote: looked into markdown to try to make the above more readable.
