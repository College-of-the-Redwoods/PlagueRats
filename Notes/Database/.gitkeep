The user story assigned to me was to learn code that can communicate with the database and the game.
I unfortunately was not able to complete this task in the two week sprint.
I will however continue to research and test different way to accomplish this task.

I have gotten very familiar, with lots of help from Trevor, with Docker, Redis, and MySQL.
Specifically, I have created a Python project to test the capabilities of the redis caching system.
I was able to create a semi functioning api that can pull data from a test database.  I was also able to implement
flask into the project as well.  I still have a lot to do with this though.  Trevor has also spoken to me about
creating a seperate project for the Database group seeing as we are coding mostly in python so as soon as that happens
, I will commit and push what I have completed to that repository.
