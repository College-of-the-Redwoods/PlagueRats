This is the research I have for finding a viable tool to use for our database:

NoSQL Database Management Tools
These tools are designed specifically for NoSQL databases and usually provide graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to interact with and pull data from NoSQL databases.

MongoDB
-> MongoDB Compass
-> Robo 3T
-> Studio 3T

CouchDB
-> CouchDB Fauxton
-> Couchbase Console

Cassandra
-> Cassandra Query Language (CQL) Shell
-> DataStax Studio

Redis
-> RedisInsight

Firebase Realtime Database/Firestore
-> Firebase Console

Data Integration Tools (For NoSQL Databases)
These tools are designed to extract data from NoSQL databases, transform it, and integrate it with other systems or applications.

Talend: While Talend is more commonly used for SQL databases, it also supports NoSQL databases (like MongoDB and Cassandra). You can use its drag-and-drop interface to extract data from NoSQL databases and perform transformations before loading it into other systems.

Apache Nifi: A powerful data integration tool that supports multiple NoSQL sources, including MongoDB and Cassandra. Nifi allows you to automate data flows with a visual interface, which is ideal for integrating NoSQL data into your workflow.

Fivetran: A managed ETL service that can sync data from NoSQL databases like MongoDB into data warehouses. It automates the process of data extraction and transformation without requiring SQL knowledge.
